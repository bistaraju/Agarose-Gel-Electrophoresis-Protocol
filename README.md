# Agarose Gel Electrophoresis Protocol
Protocol for conducting Agarose Gel Electrophoresis in **Forest Genetics Lab** | Michigan State University

## Preparing Agarose Gel (100 ml)
- [x] Put **1 g of Agarose** powder into a flask, to prepare **1%** gel.

  >Gel % (Weight/Volume) = (g of agarose / mL of buffer) x 100%.
  >
  >Gel percentage controls pore size, and thereby influences the separation and resolution of nucleic acid fragments. In general, higher-percentage gels result in better separation and resolution of smaller fragments

- Add **100 ml** of **1× TAE Buffer**.  
  > TAE buffer (Tris-acetate with EDTA): better separation of large fragments, has low ionic strength and low buffering capacity, better shorter runs, good for downstream enzymatic application.
  > TBE buffer (Tris-borate with EDTA): better for shorter fragments, high ionic strength and buffering ability (good for longer runs), less prone to overheating.
  >  
    Ensure concentration. If the TBE buffer is not in 1× conc., use formula 
  >  
  >  C<sub>1</sub> × V<sub>1</sub> = C<sub>2</sub> × V<sub>2</sub>
  >  
  >  C<sub>1</sub> = Conc. of TAE buffer (10× for eg.),
  > 
  >  V<sub>1</sub> = needed vol. of TAE buffer,
  >  
  >  C<sub>2</sub> = Conc. of 1× buffer to be made),
  >  
  >  V<sub>2</sub> = Vol. (100 ml) of 1× buffer to be made
  >
  > V<sub>1</sub>= 1 × 100/10 = 10 ml
  > 
  > Therefore, 10 ml of 10× TAE buffer + 90 ml distilled water = 100 ml of 1× TAE buffer
  > 
  *prepare more 1× TAE buffer that will be needed to cover the Gel later*
  
- Microwave to boil/dissolve the Agarose powder completely. 
    > In doing so, cover the mouth of the flask with plastic wrap (perforate the wrap). Microwave the flask for 30 seconds and swirl the solution for 5 seconds. Microwave again for another 30 seconds, take out and swirl the solution again for 5 seconds. Repeat the 30 S microwaving and swirling until agarose particles are no longer seen. Then leave the solution to cool down.
    >> To quicken the process: to the 1 g Agarose, add about half of the 100 ml of 1× TAE buffer, microwave to dissolve completely, add the rest of the TAE buffer into it. Doing this, the Gel solution immediately is brought down to 50°-60°C)

- Add 5 µL [**GelRed**](#gelred-protocol) dye or ethidium bromide (EtBr) immediately when the flask can be hold with bare hand (50-60°C). Mix the solution well.
- Pour the cool solution into the Casting Tray immediately and Put the comb. Push bubbles, if exist, down to the end. Wait for the Gel to solidify (10-15 minutes).

# Running Gel
- Place the solidified Gel in an Electrophoresis unit.
- Pour 1× TAE buffer (the same buffer used in preparing the Gel) from one end of tank of the electrophoresis unit until the Gel is covered by 1-2 mm layer of the buffer
- Take out the comb, pulling up gently and carefully, without breaking the wells in the Gel.
- Prepare ladder and samples with 6× loading dye (to track how far DNA sample has traveled).
    > Approx. 12 μl of sample can be loaded into each 6 mm wide well, and approx. 4 μl can be loaded into each 2 mm wide well. Therefore, according to the size of the comb used to make the wells, use the volume of sample + loading dye. Keep in mind that overloading a sample or ladder can result in smearing of bands and masking those nearby, resulting in poor resolution, particularly when the fragments are of similar sizes.
- Load the ladder (5 μL) (pre-cut DNA with known size of fragments, also called standard or marker) in the first well. Then load samples in other wells. Ensure the ladder and samples sink to the bottom of the well. Final volume of ladder and samples will typically occupy at least 30% of the well volume.
  
     *Prepare a sketch in a piece of paper to ensure which sample went to which well*
- Supply the power to the Electrophoresis unit. Connect Black (Cathode) to Black and Red (Anode) to Red. Set 120 v potential difference. And, run for 40-50 minutes or until the dye has migrated to an appropriate distance. How do we know how much voltage is needed? <1kb DNA fragments: 5-10 V/cm with TBE being the optimal buffer. Run time depends on length of Gel, voltage used, and sizes of sample molecules. Usually, gel is run until the band of interest has migrated 40-60% of the gel length or the dye has migrated 80% of the gel length. Monitor to ensure the smallest molecules do not migrate off the gel.
    > 75-100 V is recommended. Although, it’s slower, provides detailed separation/better resolution (for smaller fragments)
    > 
    > 100-150 V: Although faster, it may sacrifice some resolution.

# GelRed Protocol						

### Precast Agarose Gel
1. Add GelRed to molten Agarose at 1× final concentration.
2. Cast gel and run samples
   
    - Recommended loading is 50-200 ng DNA/ladder per plane
   
    - Overloading DNA can lead to poor band migration
   
    - If more DNA load needed, use post-staining protocol

### Post-staining Agarose Gel
1. Run samples with no DNA gel stain added.
2. Dilute GelRed in water at 3× final concentration
   
    eg.: we have 0.5 ml of 10000× GelRed® and we have to make 50 ml of 3× staining solution	
   
    C<sub>1</sub> × V<sub>1</sub> = C<sub>2</sub> × V<sub>2</sub>
   
    or, 10000 × V<sub>1</sub> = 3 × 50

    or, V<sub>1</sub> = (3 × 50) ÷10000
   
     = 0.015 ml (because V<sub>1</sub> was in ml)
   
     = 15 µl of 10,000× GelRed

   Now, to make 50 ml of 3× GelRed stain, (50 ml - 15 µl =) 49.985 ml water is needed



   
3. Place gel in clean container with enough 3× GelRed stain to cover (submerge) gel and incubate with rocking for 30 minutes
