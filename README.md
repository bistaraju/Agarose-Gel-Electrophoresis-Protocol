# Agarose Gel Electrophoresis Protocol
Protocol for conducting Agarose Gel Electrophoresis in [**Forest Genetics Lab**](https://www.canr.msu.edu/Forest-Genetics-Lab/) at Michigan State University. 
<br/><br/><br/>
## Preparing Agarose Gel 

>>Agarose gels have larger and less uniform pores (ranging from 100 to 500 nm) compared to acrylamide gels, making them ideal for separating nucleic acids, which typically involve larger fragments than those in protein separations. Additionally, agarose gels provide superior fragment separation in horizontal runs, which are designed for thicker gels (over 2 mm) compared to vertical runs.

<br/>

- Put **1 g of Agarose** powder into a flask, to prepare **1%** gel.

  >Gel % (Weight/Volume) = (g of agarose / ml of buffer) x 100%.
  >
  > ∴<br/>
  >1 g Agarose in 100 ml 1× TAE Buffer = 1% agarose gel<br/>
  >2 g agarose in 100 ml of 1× TAE Buffer = 2% agarose gel, and so on
  >
  >Gel percentage controls pore size, and thereby influences the separation and resolution of nucleic acid fragments. In general, higher-percentage gels result in better separation and resolution of smaller fragments

- Add **100 ml** of **1× TAE Buffer**.

  >> Consider about **1000 ml** (using a Horizontal Minigel Systems (model B2) with 800 ml buffer capacity and 12×14 cm<sup>2</sup> gel size).
  
  >:small_blue_diamond: **TAE buffer (Tris-acetate with EDTA)**: better separation of large fragments, has low ionic strength and buffering capacity, better shorter runs, good for downstream enzymatic application.<br/>
  >:small_blue_diamond: **TBE buffer (Tris-borate with EDTA)**: better for shorter fragments, has high ionic strength and buffering ability, good for longer runs, less prone to overheating.

- Microwave the flask to **dissolve the Agarose powder** completely.<br/>
  
  > In doing so, cover the mouth of the flask with plastic wrap (perforate the wrap). Microwave the flask for 30 seconds and swirl the solution for 5 seconds. Microwave again for another 30 seconds, take out and swirl the solution again for 5 seconds. Repeat the 30 second microwaving and swirling until agarose particles are no longer seen. Then leave the solution to cool down to ~60°C.
    >> *To quicken the process*: To the 1 g Agarose, add about half of the 100 ml (~50 ml) of 1× TAE buffer, microwave to dissolve completely, add the rest of the TAE buffer into it. Doing this, the Gel solution immediately is brought down near to 60-70°C)

- **Add 10 µL [**GelRed**](#gelred-protocol) dye** ~~or ethidium bromide (EtBr)~~ immediately when the flask can be hold with bare hand (50-60°C). Mix the solution well.
  
- **Pour the cool solution into the Casting Tray** (Gasketed UV Transmissible (UVT) Gel Tray) immediately and insert a comb to form sample wells. Push bubbles, if exist, down to the end. Wait for the Gel to solidify (10-15 minutes).
  >>The rubber gaskets on two unwalled sides of the tray are there to avoid leaking the gel when setting the gel in the tray fit within the electrophoresis unit. If not, masking tape can be used to make walls on those two sides of the gel tray.

# Running Gel
- **Place the solidified Gel in an Electrophoresis unit** (make sure the unit is not plugged to the power). Ensure the comb (sample wells) side of the gel is toward the Cathode side (black).
  >
  >> DNA (negative) runs towards anode (red)
- **Pour 1× TAE buffer (the same buffer used in preparing the Gel) from one end of tank** of the electrophoresis unit until the Gel is covered by 1-2 mm layer of the buffer. *Too little buffer may cause the gel to dry out during the run, while excess buffer may decrease DNA mobility and cause band distortion*.
- Take out the comb, pulling up gently and carefully, without breaking the wells in the Gel.
- **Prepare ladder** (pre-cut DNA with known size of fragments, also called standard or marker) **and samples** with **6× DNA loading dye** (to track how far DNA sample has traveled during the run) **and load in the respective well in the Gel**. *DNA samples taken out of -20°C freezer needs to be thawed well. Vortex the samples for 2-4 seconds to ensure even distribution of DNA in the solution.*
  >>> Approx. 12 μl of sample can be loaded into each 6 mm wide well, and approx. 4 μl can be loaded into each 2 mm wide well. Therefore, according to the size of the comb used to make the wells, use the volume of sample + loading dye. Keep in mind that overloading a sample or ladder can result in smearing of bands and masking those nearby, resulting in poor resolution, particularly when the fragments are of similar sizes.
  
  - Place a piece of **parafilm** on a tube rack and make** wells** for each of the ladder and the samples.  *Label the wells*.<br/>
    
  - Add **1 µl loading dye** in each well with a pipette tip. Add **4 µl DNA ladder** into its well. While adding samples to the dye, pipetting up and down carefully for 2-3 times mixes the ladder well with the dye. Then **load the dyed ladder in the first well of the gell**. Ensure the ladder sinks to the bottom of the well. *it typically occupies at least 30% of the well volume. <br/>
    
  - Use seperate pipette tips to **mix each DNA sample and the loading dye in their respective parafilm well**. Load the dyed samples in their respective wells in the gel.  :point_right: *Prepare a sketch in a piece of paper to ensure which sample went to which well*
    > 
    - **Load the ladder in the first well.** Then load **samples in other wells**. Ensure the ladder and samples sink to the bottom of the well. Final volume of ladder and samples will typically occupy at least 30% of the well volume.
  

- Supply the power to the Electrophoresis unit to **Run the gel**. 
    > Put the cover of the electrophoresis unit. Connect Black (Cathode) to Black and Red (Anode) to Red. Set **120 V** potential difference. And, run for **40-50 minutes** or until the dye has migrated to an appropriate distance.
    > >How do we know how much voltage is needed?
    > >><1kb DNA fragments: 5-10 V/cm with TBE being the optimal buffer. Run time depends on length of Gel, voltage used, and sizes of sample molecules. Usually, gel is run until the band of interest has migrated 40-60% of the gel length or the dye has migrated 80% of the gel length. Monitor to ensure the smallest molecules do not migrate off the gel.
    > 
    > >75-100 V is recommended. Although, it’s slower, provides detailed separation/better resolution (for smaller fragments)<br/>
    > >100-150 V, although faster, it may sacrifice some resolution.

# GelRed Protocol						

### Precast Agarose Gel
1. Add GelRed to molten Agarose at 1× final concentration.
2. Cast gel and run samples
   
    - Recommended loading is 50-200 ng DNA/ladder per plane
   
    - Overloading DNA can lead to poor band migration
   
    - If more DNA load needed, use post-staining protocol

   
3.  Image

### Post-staining Agarose Gel
1. Run samples with no DNA gel stain added.
2. Dilute GelRed in water at 3× final concentration
   
    eg.: we have 0.5 ml of 10000× GelRed® and we have to make 50 ml of 3× staining solution	
   
    **C<sub>1</sub> × V<sub>1</sub> = C<sub>2</sub> × V<sub>2</sub>**
   
    or, 10000 × **V<sub>1</sub>** = 3 × 50

    or, **V<sub>1</sub>** = (3 × 50) ÷10000
   
     = 0.015 ml (because V<sub>1</sub> was in ml)
   
     = 15 µl of 10,000× GelRed

   Now, to make **50 ml** of **3×** GelRed stain, (50 ml - 15 µl =) **49.985 ml** water is needed

   
3. Place gel in clean container with enough 3× GelRed stain to cover (submerge) gel and incubate with rocking for 30 minutes
